# Angular TodoList

This repository contains a basic TodoList application built using Angular. The project is designed to help beginners get familiar with Angular concepts and workflows. It implements a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using the browser's local storage for data persistence.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Create new tasks with ease.
- **View Todos**: Display all existing tasks in a list.
- **Update Todos**: Edit task details.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Data is stored in the browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.
